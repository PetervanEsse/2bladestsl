					<p>



<p> A Post-doctoral position is available in the 2Blades group at the Sainsbury Laboratory. The appointee will deploy state-of-the-art methods to identify novel resistance genes effective against Asian soybean rust, a key challenge for growers in Brazil. You will have significant responsibility for carrying out the experimental challenges in the project. The main activities will involve genetic mapping, next-generation sequencing, handling large data sets and basic informatics. In addition, the successful candidate will explore the use of fungal effectors to accelerate the breeding and will conduct a functional analysis of candidate genes using transient and stable expression systems. We seek an individual with outstanding talent and abilities in molecular biology, phytopathology and/or genetics. The successful candidate will have a demonstrated record of achievement in academia or industry, and an eagerness to work as part of a multi-disciplinary, international team in collaboration with industry. Experience in quantitative genetics and genomics, working with obligate biotrophic pathogens and/or map-based cloning would be highly advantageous.</p> 

<p> Essential requirements include:</p>

<p> - highly skilled in molecular biology, plant breeding, phytopathology and /or genetics </p>
<p> - a Ph.D. in bioinformatics, phytopathology, plant or molecular biology</p>
<p> - a demonstrable record of achievement in academia or industry</p>
<p> - an ability to operate as part of a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, international team</p>
<p> - excellent writing, interpersonal and problem-solving skills</p>
<p> -talent for communication with a diverse range of partners and stakeholders</p>
<p> -drive to see research outcomes reach practical application</p>


<p> The salary will be within the UEA Research and Analogous Staff Grade 7 scale at between £33,199 and £39,609 pa; however, the appointment level will reflect qualifications, skills, knowledge and achievements. The position is available for two years in the first instance from March 2019, with possibility for extension.</p>

<p> Applicants should provide a CV, including the names and contact details of two referees, and a covering letter addressing the selection criteria. Applications may be submitted online using the ‘Apply’ button below. Alternatively, please send formal applications, quoting the reference  YG01/2020, either by email to HR@tsl.ac.uk or by post to Lynda Barnes, HR Advisor, The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich Research Park, Norwich, NR4 7UH, UK.</p>
