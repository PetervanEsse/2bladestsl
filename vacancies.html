							<header><h2><strong>Postdoctoral position to identify novel resistance sources effective against major corn diseases <strong></h2>
					<p>



<p> A postdoctoral position is available to join ongoing projects in the 2Blades group in the team of Kamil Witek at The Sainsbury Laboratory. Using state-of-the-art techniques, you will be involved in the identification of genetic solutions to increase corn resistance towards fungal pathogens in collaboration with industry. We are looking for a creative, enthusiastic candidate capable of independent research, who will contribute to a collaborative, multi-disciplinary and international team.</p> 

<p> Applicants must hold a PhD degree in a relevant field. Candidates should be highly motivated individuals interested in plant pathology and will want to see their research reach a practical application. Previous work on plant/pathogen interactions is desirable but not required. Experience in protein extraction from microbial cultures and advanced protein purification (e.g. FPLC) is required. Experience in bioinformatic analysis would be highly advantageous. Applicants must possess excellent writing and communication skills in English.</p>

<p> The salary will be within the UEA Research and Analogous Staff Grade 7 scale at between £33,199 and £39,609 pa; however, the appointment level will reflect qualifications, skills, knowledge and achievements. The position is available for two years in the first instance from March 2019, with possibility for extension.</p>

<p> The Sainsbury Laboratory (TSL) is a world leader in plant and microbial science that is dedicated to making fundamental discoveries in the science of plant-microbe interactions. TSL has expanded its scientific mission not only to continue providing fundamental biological insights into plant-pathogen interactions, but also to deliver novel, genomics-based solutions that will significantly reduce losses from major crop diseases, especially in developing countries. For more information please visit www.tsl.ac.uk</p>

<p> The position is open until June 2019. Applicants should provide a CV, including the names and contact details of two or more referees, and a cover letter of no more than one A4 addressing the selection criteria. Please send formal applications, quoting the reference KW-2/2019, either by e-mail to HR@TSL.ac.uk or by post to Lynda Barnes HR Advisor, The Sainsbury Laboratory, Norwich Research Park, Colney, Norwich, NR4 7UH, UK</p>
