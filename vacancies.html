							<header><h2><strong>Bioinformatics position in molecular genetics and plant pathology<strong></h2>
					<p>

A position is available in the 2Blades group of Peter van Esse at the Sainsbury Laboratory. The appointee will deploy state-of-the-art bioinformatic approaches to identify novel resistance genes effective against major diseases of crops, and will have significant responsibility for addressing the bioinformatic challenges in the project. The main activity will be to develop methods that accelerate resistance gene discovery. In addition, the successful candidate will be involved in genomic studies of rust fungi. 
We seek an individual with outstanding talent and abilities in Bioinformatics. The successful candidate will have a demonstrated record of achievement in academia or industry, and an eagerness to work as part of a collaborative, multi-disciplinary, international team in collaboration with industry. Candidates would be advantaged by an understanding of high-throughput genomic analysis and familiarity with widely used genomic databases and methods.  Competence with bioinformatic scripting languages, particularly Python and/or Perl, is essential, as is experience handling data from the Illumina platform or other high throughput sequence systems. A PhD in bioinformatics or biology is required. The successful candidate has excellent writing skills and a talent for communication. In addition, the successful candidate has an interest to see research outcomes reach practical application. 
We offer a salary within the UEA Research and Analogous staff Grade scale 7 between £32,548 and £38,833; however, the appointment level will reflect qualifications, skills, knowledge and achievements. 
The position will initially be a three-year appointment with possibility for a two-year extension. </p>

							<header><h2><strong>Postdoctoral position: Identification of resistance against Soybean Rust<strong></h2>
					<p>

A position is available in the 2Blades group of Peter van Esse at the Sainsbury Laboratory. The appointee will deploy state-of-the-art methods to identify novel resistance genes effective against Soybean Rust, a key challenge for growers in Brazil. You will have significant responsibility for carrying out the experimental challenges in the project. The main activities will involve genetic mapping, next-generation sequencing and basic informatics. In addition, the successful candidate will explore the use of fungal effectors to accelerate breeding and will conduct functional analysis of candidate genes using transient and stable expression systems. 
We seek an individual with outstanding talent and abilities in molecular biology, phytopathology and/or genetics. The successful candidate will have a demonstrated record of achievement in academia or industry, and an eagerness to work as part of a multi-disciplinary, international team in collaboration with industry. The successful candidate has excellent writing skills and a talent for communication. In addition, the successful candidate has an interest in plant disease resistance and a desire to see research outcomes reach practical application. Experience in working with obligate biotrophic pathogens and/or map-based cloning would be highly advantageous. A PhD in bioinformatics, phytopathology, plant or molecular biology is required.
We offer a salary within the UEA Research and Analogous staff Grade 7 scale between £32,548 and £38,833; however, the appointment level will reflect qualifications, skills, knowledge and achievements. 
The position will initially be a three-year appointment with possibility for a two-year extension.
