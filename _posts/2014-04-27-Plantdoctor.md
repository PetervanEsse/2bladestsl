On 13th June, BSPP Outreach headed to Hethersett VC Junior School in Norfolk to run a whole day of plant doctor activities. We hunted for plant pathogens in the school playing field, made models of plant pathogens, trained to become plant doctors and examined everything under microscopes. It was a great day!
