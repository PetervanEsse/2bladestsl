The 2Blades group got together for our annual pumpkin carving competition! Congratulations to Everton for the creepiest pumpkin, Lesley for the funniest pumpkin, Kelly for the most artistic pumpkin, and Shona and Yogesh's family who tied for the prize for best overall pumpkin. And thank you Kelly for organising!
