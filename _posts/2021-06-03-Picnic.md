For the first time in over a year, the whole group were able to meet in person for a socially distanced outdoor picnic! Lovely to properly welcome <a href="http://www.tsl.ac.uk/staff/shona-strachan/"> Shona </a> and <a href="http://www.tsl.ac.uk/staff/henry-jennings/"> Henry </a>, who both started in the group during lockdown. And well done Peter for booking the sunshine!
